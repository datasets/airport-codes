## Description

The airport codes may refer to either [IATA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code)
airport code, a three-letter code which is used in passenger reservation, ticketing and baggage-handling systems, or the [ICAO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization_airport_code) airport code
which is a four letter code used by ATC systems and for airports that do not have an IATA airport code (from wikipedia).

Airport codes from around the world. Downloaded from public domain source http://ourairports.com/data/ who compiled this data from multiple different sources. This data is updated nightly.

## Data

"data/airport-codes.csv" contains the list of all airport codes, the attributes are identified in datapackage description. Some of the columns contain attributes identifying airport locations, other codes (IATA, local if exist) that are relevant to identification of an airport.  
Original source url is http://ourairports.com/data/airports.csv  (stored in archive/data.csv)  

> Note: Currently the scripts is run automatically using Github Actions

## Preparation

You will need Python 3.6 or greater and [dataflows](https://pypi.org/project/dataflows/) library to run the script

To update the data run the process script locally:
```bash
# To run locally you should do this
# Install using requirements
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
python3 scripts/process.py
python3 scripts/airport-codes-flow.py

# Run the script
make run
make clean
```

Several steps will be done to get the final data.

* merge columns "latitude_deg" and "longitude_deg" into "coordinates"
* remove columns: "id",  "scheduled_service", "home_link", "wikipedia_link", "keywords"

## Automation
