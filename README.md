The airport codes may refer to either [IATA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code)
airport code, a three-letter code which is used in passenger reservation, ticketing and baggage-handling systems, or the [ICAO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization_airport_code) airport code 
which is a four letter code used by ATC systems and for airports that do not have an IATA airport code (from wikipedia).
